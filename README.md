# Challenge-3: Password Generator

## Description

This project represents a password generator that allows users to create random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. The criteria includes password length and character types. Furthermore, for character types the user is asked whether to include numbers, symbols, lowercase and uppercase characters or not. If a non-valid password length is entered, the user is alerted and the application resets. If no character types are selected, the user is alerted and the application resets. Once all user inputs are validated, a password is generated and displayed on the screen, matching the length and the character types selected.
